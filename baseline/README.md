As noted in the project README, the code developed on Colab. If developed locally, functions would be reused where possible, so that documentation need only be written once. 

In this case, documentation has to be repeated across all notebooks. To minimise repetition, the following files in this foder have been documented:

1. `Generate_baseline_gpt_35_turbo.ipynb` -- the GPT 4 version is identical except for the model constant (`MODEL`), but has not been documented as described above
2. `Generate_baseline_phi_3.ipynb` -- the sections which difffer from the GPT 3.5 notebook have been documented.
