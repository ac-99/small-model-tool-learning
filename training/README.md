As noted in the project README, the code developed on Colab. If developed locally, functions would be reused where possible, so that documentation need only be written once. 

In this case, documentation has to be repeated across all notebooks. To minimise repetition, the following files in this foder have been documented:

1. `tran-phi-3.ipynb`. The other scripts are identical but have a single parameter changed (`LR`). Sections which are identical to scripts in baseline were not documented.
